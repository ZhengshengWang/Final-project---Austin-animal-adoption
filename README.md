# Final-project---Austin-animal-adoption
Machine Learning - Zhengsheng, Sergio, Victoria, Flora

Our goal was to determine whether we could predict the likelihood of an animal being adopted based on its characteristics. To explore this, we analyzed a dataset from Austin, Texas Animal Services, which contains detailed information about animals admitted to the shelter.

Using this dataset, we developed visualizations to identify adoption trends and understand the demographics of the shelter population. Additionally, we built a machine learning model using Random Forests to predict the likelihood of adoption based on factors such as age (in days), breed, color, fixed status, animal type, and sex.
